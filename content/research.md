## Research Experience

### Graduate Researcher, Convex Optimization
*Advisor: Prof. Stephen Boyd (Sept 2024 - Present)*

- Develop portfolio liquidation strategies using **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** and **convex optimization** to minimize implementation shortfall while tracking a benchmark.
- Engineer a high-fidelity backtesting framework in **Python** using **CVXPY**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy** to simulate multi-period portfolio transitions under transaction costs and market impact models.
- Implement efficient numerical methods, including sparse **Cholesky factorization**, to accelerate optimization solver performance within the simulation environment.

### Graduate Researcher, Fixed Income Modeling
*Advisor: Prof. Darrell Duffie (Dec 2024 - Present)*

- Model off-the-run bond inventories and dealer behavior by formulating and solving **Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations** to derive optimal trading policies.
- Develop dynamic market equilibrium experiments in **Python** and **Julia**, providing actionable insights for bond market structure and liquidity analysis.

### Graduate Researcher, AI and ML in Computational Pathology
*Advisor: Dr. Andrew Gentles (Jan 2025 - Present)*

- Lead development of HExIF, an end-to-end **PyTorch** pipeline that generates virtual multiplex immunofluorescence images from H&E stains, reducing analysis time and cost.
- Architect and train conditional GANs (**pix2pix**) and multi-task **U-Net** models to synthesize fluorescence intensity maps and cell segmentation masks from histopathology inputs.

### Research Assistant, Machine Learning, NLP & Time-Series Analysis
*American University of Beirut (Sept 2022 - Aug 2024)*

- **Co-author** in "Opportunities for circular economy in waste reuse: Insights from social media data mining", journal of Resources, Conservation & Recycling. Applying transfer learning on 10,000+ scraped articles.
- Engineered regression models to quantify equity price delay and conducted a 20-year sentiment-based time-series analysis of 1,200+ financial reports, identifying signals of market inefficiency.
- Fine-tuned a MobileNetV2 image classifier in **TensorFlow**, improving accuracy by **15%** on specialized datasets for a co-authored publication on waste reuse analysis.
