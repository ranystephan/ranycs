I am a graduate student at Stanford University pursuing an M.S. in Mathematical and Computational Finance. I have a background in finance, computer science, and applied mathematics from the American University of Beirut. My research interests lie at the intersection of these fields, with a focus on applying quantitative and computational techniques to solve complex financial problems.
