## Research Experience
- **[Convex Optimization for Portfolio Transition (cvxtransition)]({{< relref "research" >}}#graduate-researcher-convex-optimization-for-portfolio-transition)** (June 2025 -- Present)
  - Advisor: Prof. Stephen Boyd
  - Developing portfolio transition strategies using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and convex optimization to minimize implementation shortfall while tracking a benchmark. **Manuscript in progress.**
- **[Fixed Income Modeling]({{< relref "research" >}}#graduate-researcher-fixed-income-modeling)** (Dec 2024 -- Present)
  - Advisor: Prof. Darrell Duffie
  - Modeling off-the-run bond inventories and dealer behavior by formulating and solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations to derive analytically-grounded optimal control. **Manuscript in progress.**
- **[AI and ML in Computational Pathology (HExIF)]({{< relref "research" >}}#graduate-researcher-ai-and-ml-in-computational-pathology)** (Jan 2025 -- Present)
  - Advisor: Dr. Andrew Gentles
  - Leading the development of HExIF, an end-to-end PyTorch pipeline that generates virtual multiplex immunofluorescence images from H&E stains, reducing analysis time and cost. **Manuscript in preparation.**
- **[Machine Learning, NLP & Time-Series Analysis]({{< relref "research" >}}#research-assistant-machine-learning-nlp-time-series-analysis)** (Sept 2022 -- Aug 2024)
  - Co-authored 'Opportunities for circular economy in waste reuse: Insights from social media data mining', a journal paper in Resources, Conservation & Recycling. Applied transfer learning on over 10,000 scraped articles.

## Projects & Competitions

- **Teaching Assistant, [Stanford MLab](https://www.stanfordacm.org/mlab)** (Oct 2025 -- Present)
  - Advise and participate with student teams on [SemEval-2026](https://semeval.github.io/) (e.g., Task 8: multi-turn RAG evaluation; Task 3: DimABSA; Task 2: temporal emotion modeling), emphasizing rigorous evaluation and clean computational semantics pipelines.
- **NeuralFin** (Winner, Murex Best Development Project Award, \$3,000, June 2023)
  - NeuralFin: A full-stack research platform (Django, Python) for predictive signals. It features data ingestion, feature engineering, cross-validation, and backtest reporting, designed for rapid iterate→evaluate→ship cycles.
- **Refinitiv Portfolio Management Competition** (University Representative, Oct 2023)
