This study examines reuse as a primary waste prevention strategy within this framework. It identifies commonly reused items and assesses the environmental benefits of online second-hand shops versus disposal or purchasing new items. AI methodologies, including information retrieval and machine learning, analyzed over 1000 images from Lebanese Instagram thrift shops to train a classifier. Environmental impacts were quantified using LCA studies. Results show textiles, clothing, and shoes are the most reused items. Online thrift shops offer affordable, sustainable clothing, reducing the need for new production. Most reused items were in good condition, indicating they can replace new ones, conserving resources. Reuse outperforms recycling, though furniture and electronics have lower reuse rates. AI's potential in waste management and the importance of sustainable reuse practices are highlighted, suggesting significant efficiency and cost improvements.}

**Abstract:**
Transitioning to circular economy requires robust waste management to minimize waste, maximize resource use, and promote recycling and reuse.

AI methodologies, including information retrieval and machine learning, analyzed over 1000 images from Lebanese Instagram thrift shops to train a classifier. Environmental impacts were quantified using LCA studies. Results show textiles, clothing, and shoes are the most reused items.
